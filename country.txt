Oh how you sparkle, and oh how you shine.
That flush on your cheeks is more than the wine.
And he must do something that I didn't do.
Whatever he's doing, it looks good on you.

You look so good in love.
You want him, that's easy to see.
You look so good in love.
And I wish you still wanted me.

He must have stolen some stars from the sky,
And gave them to you to wear in your eyes.
I had my chances, but I set you free.
And now I wonder why I couldn't see.

Darling I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you,
But tonight your beauty is shining through.
And I never took the time to let you know,
So before he takes you away please let me say.

You look so good in love. 

I knew the stakes were high right from the start.
When she dealt the cards, I bet my heart.
Now I just found a game that I can't play,
And this is where the cowboy rides away.

[Chorus:]
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun,
Setting on the things I wish I'd done.
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday.
This is where the cowboy rides away.

We've been in and out of love and in-between.
And now we play the final showdown scene.
As the credits roll a sad song starts to play,
And this is where the cowboy rides away.

[Chorus:]
And my heart is sinking like a setting sun,
Setting on the things I wish I'd done.
Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say,
And this is where the cowboy rides away.

Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say.
This is where the cowboy rides away. 

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there

They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be

I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
To that old flame that burns inside of me.
She cried when I left her, now I cry to forget her.
Oh, how foolish I was to ever want to leave.

[Chorus:]
'Cause nobody in his right mind would've left her.
I had to be crazy to say goodbye.
Nobody in his right mind would've left her.
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind.

I still carry her picture; I wish her well
With the new love I know she's found by now.
Each night finds me dreamin', each day I spend thinkin'
How much I wish she was still around.

[Chorus]

Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind. 
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be 
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus:]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

[Chorus:]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And therefor I reside in Tennessee

[Bridge]
Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee 

f you leave me, I won't miss you,
And I won't ever take you back.
Girl, your mem'ry won't ever haunt me
'Cause I don't love you, and now if you'll buy that.

[Chorus:]
I got some ocean front property in Arizona.
From my front porch you can see the sea.
I got some ocean front property in Arizona.
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the golden gate in free.

I don't worship the ground you walk on.
I never have and that's a fact.
I won't follow or try to find you
'Cause I don't love you, and now if you'll buy that.

[Chorus]

Yeah, if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free. 

What a rotten day this turned out to be.
I still can't believe she'd leave so easily.
She just got all her things, threw 'em into a pile,
Then she loaded her car and said after a while,
She'd done this before, but this time she didn't cry.

[Chorus:]
That's why I'm sittin' on the front steps,
Staring down the road, wond'rin' if she'll come back -
This time I don't know.
After she packed, when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes,
And that's got me worried thinking
Maybe my baby's gotten good at goodbye.

All the times before she'd break down and cry.
She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye.
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say.
Now I'm lost for words, since she went away.
She may not return for this time she didn't cry.

Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
I'd really ever take it this far
Singin' in the bars

[CHORUS:]
And chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream

An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord,
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

[CHORUS]

Now daddy's got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said; son I just know
We're gonna hear you singin' on it some day
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there

Well I climbed back on that eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, the shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill
And see the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there
He's always singing there, Hank's always singing there 


Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught.

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute.

Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.

Ya ha

Well, we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home.

Ya he

That's right...

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line 

I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder: one of the four beasts saying: "Come and see." And I saw. And behold, a white horse.

There's a man goin' 'round takin' names.
And he decides who to free and who to blame.
Everybody won't be treated all the same.
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
When the man comes around.

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup.
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around?

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
One hundred million angels singin'.
Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum.
Voices callin', voices cryin'.
Some are born and some are dyin'.
It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come.

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
The virgins are all trimming their wicks.
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

'Til Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom.
Then the father hen will call his chickens home.
The wise men will bow down before the throne.
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around.

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still.
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still.
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still.
Listen to the words long-written down,
When the man comes around.

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
One hundred million angels singin'.
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettle drum.
Voices callin', voices cryin'.
Some are born and some are dyin'.
It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come.

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
The virgins are all trimming their wicks.
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around.

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts, and I looked and behold: a pale horse. And his name, that sat on him, was Death. And Hell followed with him. 

I  hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I oh oh oh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught em yet
Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
'If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Yippie I oh oh oh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky 

She's got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
You're gonna look twice when she gets to walkin'
In a honky tonk
With them blue jeans on

She's a cold beer, a whiskey shot, a neon light
A Strait song on the jukebox, a dance all night
What a cowboy wants
A never-do-wrong

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

I was reckless and wild, didn't think I was ready
Couldn't settle me down, so I fired up my Chevy
I was stubborn and she was cryin'
Well, she knew she couldn't stop me but she kept right on tryin'

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

She's the kind of girl that only comes around once
Well she found somebody new and I'm goin' crazy because

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves
Nobody leaves a girl like that
A girl like that 

Her hands wrapped up in mine
Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still I can't keep from smilin'
'Cause damn that girl can fly

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

A tumbleweed heart, chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy 

Her hands wrapped up in mine
Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still I can't keep from smilin'
'Cause damn that girl can fly

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

A tumbleweed heart, chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless, runnin', searchin' for somethin'
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy 

Pardon me, I don't mean to pry
I saw the tears fallin' from your eyes, and I thought
You're too pretty not to wear a smile
Hope you don't mind if I sit down for awhile, 'cause

I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you want tequila little time with me too

We don't have to talk about the past
Here's to movin' forward and not lookin' back
Little later, we can take it to the dance floor, but
Until then, let's order a couple more, 'cause

I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you want tequila little time with me too

It's good to see you laughin'
I guess this had to happen
Now let's just get to dancin', 'cause

I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you want tequila little time with me too

Hope you want tequila little time with me too
Hope you want tequila little time with me too

I'm a ghost on the radio
A needle on the vinyl
A country boy survival
The bottom of a bottle
I'm a fightin' side of you and me
And my heart's down in Tennessee

And I sing songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky-tonks
And cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can't even recognize me
They used to call me Country

Used to have cool names like 'Willie' and 'Waylon'
'Merle' and 'Hank'
We all stood together
We sang and we drank
Chased the white lines
Night after night

Singin' songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky-tonks
And cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can't even recognize me
They used to call me Country

Like an Old Violin
Put away and never played again
Paycheck and Cash
Naw, they ain't comin' back

They did songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky tonks
And cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can't even recognize me
They used to call me Country

They used to call me Country
I'm a thing of the past
I'm a ghost on the radio 

Appreciate your call, means a lot and all
Yeah, I got a minute
You and me can talk about anything you want
As long as she ain't in it
Say, it's been at least a month since I've had any fun
Buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, I might be going out
Think I'm ready for a crowd
As long as she ain't in it

Don't wanna hear her name
Don't wanna see her face
I swear, I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

We could hit that place down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it

Don't wanna hear her name
Don't wanna see her face
I swear, I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

I can drink and I can dance
I can party and I can laugh
No matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life won't be the same
As long as she ain't in it
As long as she ain't in it

Well I woke up Sunday mornin', with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad, so I had one more, for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet, for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair and, stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before on, cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid cussin' at a can, that he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin', that I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way

On the Sunday morning sidewalks, wishin' Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin', half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city side walks, Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy, with a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the Sunday morning sidewalks, wishin' Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin', half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city side walks, Sunday mornin' comin' down 


I was fifteen when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard when my face turned green
He said “You come from a long line of sinners like me”

Now me and my brother go to see him some times
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D.
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me

My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
So she had two more just like him
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me

Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own
And when the doctor smacks him, he'll probably take a swing
Cause he'll come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me

On the day I die
I know where I'm gonna go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates til his face I see
And stand in a long line of sinners like me
I'll stand in a long line of sinners like me

La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
Here’s to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me


These boots have counted off many a band
Playing one night roadhouse stands
For tips in empty rooms
These boots have stood toe-to-toe
with the biggest baddest joes
Like they had some things to prove
These boots

Yeah these boots more than once have saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
And these boots have danced with the devil
and nearly lost that battle
to a wild-eyed Irish Rose

[Chorus:]
I wore out more soles than I care to count
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
for the roads they led me down
but the damndest thing I've ever seen them do
is walkin' out on you.

These boots had to see California
and an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
Thought that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes

[Chorus]

Now these boots are one step from the door
They walked out of years before
I can almost see her now
These boots ought to kick that door aside
Stomp out my foolish pride
But they just turn around
Damn these boots
Damn these boots
These boots

I remember waitin’ by the curb with Mr. Murphy
When daddy picked me up from school his eyes were red
We drove to the hospital in a hurry
Where my family gathered round my Grandpa’s bed
He was my best friend
He taught me how to fish
And I cried listenin to my daddy pray
For one of those I’ve loved along the way

She had a ribbon in her hair the day I met her
That whole next year we couldn’t get enough
And after graduation she took off for Denver
And for awhile we both tried to keep in touch
She was my best friend
And it broke my heart
But I don’t regret the day that she became
One of those I’ve loved along the way

And I hope they know
I never woulda made it this far on my own
Where would we all be without those
Fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
The friends I’ve made, the long lost lovers
I wouldn’t be who I am today
If not for those I’ve loved along the way
Along the way

Now I’m just a country boy with a guitar
Lookin’ back down this old road I’ve been travelin’ on
It was never about tryin’ to be some big star
For me it’s always been about these songs
You see they’re my best friends
They’re the life I live
And I hope they put a smile on the face
Of those that I’ve loved along the way
‘Cause I wouldn’t be the man I am today
If not for those I’ve loved along the way

To this day when I hear that song,
I see you standing there on that lawn
Discount shades, store-bought tan,
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun,
"I'm On Fire" and "Born To Run"
You looked at me and I was done,
And we, we're just getting started

I was singing to you, you were singing to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you saying, "Don't go."

When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name,
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm

Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born In The USA
You relive those glory days so long ago

When you think about me
Do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen, oh, Springsteen 


Yeah, I'd give this last wrinkled dollar
In my pocket that I earned
With a hammer and vice
If I could undo some things
And grow me some wings
Fly out of this quarter tonight

Yeah, tonight, every man with a TV
Is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
In the last thirty minutes
I've gone from a person of interest
To a full-blown manhunt underway

I did what I did
I have no regrets
When you cross the line
You get what you get

Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

I'm a ghost dodging bullets
In all of these alleys
Just looking for my getaway keys
Wrapped up in the night
Hiding out in plain sight
But this grip's getting tight around me

Ain't no getting out
That I can see
They'll take me dead
If they ever take me

Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

What I wouldn't do
For just one more kiss
I'm all out of time
Honey, it's come down to this

I'm haunted by your hazel eyes
And this crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did

He was just eighteen
Full of fire and gasoline
He was lean and mean
And they called him Texas

He went off to war
To a far and distant shore
He'd never left his home before
He was from Texas

As they stormed that beach one foggy summer day
He said if I don't make it back promise me one thing

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas

Well she was just eighteen
Prettiest thing he'd ever seen
Like a real life beauty queen
And someday she'd be his wife

But for the next four years
She fought back her tears
While he fought back his fears
Fighting for his life

And in his darkest hours
Her love would bring him a light
He would read her letters
He would pray at night

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas

He always said the real heroes
Never made it back home
And though the war was long over
You know for him it still lived on
And it still lives on

When he was eighty-three
Still full of fire and gasoline
He was still lean and mean
And they still called him Texas

And on the day he died
She was right there by his side
She held his hand as she softly sang his lullaby

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me
You can bury me
You can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't ever gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
Its always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yah the dark days find a way

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't ever gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

The camera captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yah but who needs that anyway

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't ever gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't ever gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Loud thunder heavy rain...
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't ever gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain...
Loud thunder heavy rain... 

I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am

It wasn't no gun they held to my head
I got caught up believing in lies that were said
And in a moment of weakness
I stumbled and I made my bed

I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am

There's 10,000 reasons for you not to stay
And no one would blame you
If you want it that way
It might take some time
But I'll show you that I'm worth the wait

I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am
And I'll spend forever, do all that I can
To prove I'm not the devil you think that I am
And I'm not the devil 

My whole view of the word has changed
I guess that comes with age
I don't believe there is good in every man
Like I did back then

I may drink more than I should
You've seen me on the floor
I've spent my lifetime in this cage
I built around me
Banging on the doors

And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living

Heaven knows I broke your heart
I can't take that away
All I'm worth is
Just this promise that I've made to you
To stand beside you
Just like you have stood beside me

And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living

You could be much better off
God knows without me
And that's why
I just can't find the words

You could be much better off
God Knows without me
And that's why
I just can't find the words

o I'm not goin' crazy, but lately my head and my heart
Seem to be at least a million miles apart
My heart says to love you, my head says to run
It's like my heart is too afraid to tell my head what it's done
I know that it can never be the way it was
Even though you'd be the death of me I can't give you up
Too much is not enough, it's not the love, it's not the lust that grips me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I've got "I love you" on my mind, I've got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
It must be the whiskey

No I'm not goin' crazy, but lately these thoughts in my head
Are a whirlwind of a world of a million regrets
All the things I should have done, all the things I should have said
All the pain that comes with hating the mess you've made of yourself
I know I'm chasin' rainbows thinkin' I could make it work
But the fact is that my actions speak louder than my words
And it only makes it worse thinkin' of her, thinkin' she'll forgive me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I got "I love you" on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I got "I love you" on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
Sometimes it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy
Oh, it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy
It must be the whiskey

It must be the whiskey
It must be the whiskey
It's that whiskey
It must be the whiskey 


Livin' on wings and wheels
In my mind or made of steel
If you ain't running scared and rough
Then you ain't running fast enough for me

Behind the 8 ball ain't always a bad place to be
You can get out of anything with a dollar and a dream
When your back's against the wall, you're fixed
But they can't get you from your six, you know

Maybe holdin' on to something hurts you more than lettin' go
It hit ain't hurtin', maybe it ain't workin', and it ain't worth it, no
Maybe the rain that brings the thunder will help put out the flames
Maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train

Maybe holdin' on to something hurts you more than lettin' go
It hit ain't hurtin', maybe it ain't workin', and it ain't worth it, no
Maybe the rain that brings the thunder will help put out the flames
Maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train
Maybe the light at the end of the tunnel ain't a train 

The Good Book holds reasons I believe the way I do
All I needed to know I was taught in Sunday school
But I live like those rules were for everyone but me
With selfish disregard for how it hurt my family

As I staggered down the hall to our bed
She helped steady me and said:

"How can you think like you think
Turn around and drink like you drink?
You can barely stand up when you kneel down to pray
How can you tell our children to be strong
And fight temptation in a world gone wrong?
How can you think like you think and drink like you drink?"

Bless that girl that looks out for me
With the faith and the love of a saint
Give me the strength to make sure that she
Never again has to say

"How can you think like you think
Turn around and drink like you drink?
You can barely stand up but you kneel down to pray
How can you tell our children to be strong
And fight temptation in a world gone wrong?
How can you think like you think and drink like you drink?" 

I don't go to church on Sunday
I don't go to work on Monday
I sleep until I wake up
To whiskey in my coffee cup
And I take what the good Lord gave
That's the shovel that digs my grave
I never really had a plan
But everybody knows where I stand

And in all my friends I see
The same kind of crazy as me

There's more colors than red and blue
To paint the elephant in the room
You piss and moan about that and this
There's always another ass to kiss, but
I believe that freedom rings
And I believe in the songs we sing
I have a funny way you see
What the world might someday be

Why can't they just let it be?
The same kind of crazy as me

There ain't a single thing we own
We'll take with us when we're gone
So I'll just walk the earth awhile
Lend a hand and leave a smile
And who knows how the whole thing ends?
You can't tell me where or when
So I'll just pray that when I'm done
Meet the Father and the Son

And if I'm right they'll be
The same kind of crazy as me

There ain't a single thing we own
We'll take with us when we're gone
So I'll just walk the earth awhile
Lend a hand and leave a smile
And who knows how the whole thing ends?
You can't tell me where or when
So I'll just pray that when I'm done
I'll meet the Father and the Son

And if I'm right they'll be
The same kind of crazy as me
